        <h2>Transportation Options</h2>
        <p>Almost all visitors arrive to Taniti by air, though some arrive on a small cruise ship that docks in Yellow
          Leaf Bay for one night per week. Taniti is served by a small airport that can accommodate small jets and
          propeller planes. Taniti is in the process of expanding the airport so larger jets will be able to land on the
          island within the next few years. </p>

        <h2>Local Transportation</h2>
        <p>Public buses serve Taniti City and run from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day. Private buses serve the rest of the
          island. Taxis are available in Taniti City, and rental cars can be rented from a local rental agency near the
          airport. Bikes and helmets are available to rent from several vendors (helmets are required by law). Taniti
          City is fairly flat and very walkable. Many tourists stay in the area surrounding Merriton Landing: this area
          is easy to explore on foot.</p>
